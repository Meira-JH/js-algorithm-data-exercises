// UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM WITH SIMPLE EXAMPLES:
//1. re-estate the problem in own words, constructing a simple example and naming necessary variables.
//2. how/what could be the inputs?
//3. how/what could be the outputs?

// MAKE THE EXAMPLES MORE COMPLEX
//4. what about invalid and empty inputs?
//5. what about more diverse/larger inputs?
//6. what about null, undefined or empty outputs?

// BREAK IT DOWN
//7. write down the steps needed
//8. elaborate the most natural solution
//9. refine the solution with more eficient/clean code

// FINAL REASONING
//X. Is it possible to solve the (output) problems with the inputs?
